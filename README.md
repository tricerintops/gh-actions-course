This repository contains examples and notes from the course "GitHub Actions: The Complete Guide from Beginner to Expert" on Udemy. I purchased the course for Â£14.99 on 1 September 2025.

I've made this repository public because, regarding GitHub Actions, the use of standard GitHub-hosted runners on public repositories is free and unlimited.

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-where-workflows-run/choose-the-runner-for-a-job#standard-github-hosted-runners-for-public-repositories

In other words, the reason for making this repository public has nothing to do with the idea that someone else might benefit from exploring the code in it.

The most useful thing I've learned from this course so far is that using Visual Studio with the GitHub Actions plug-in (created and maintained by GitHub) is an absolutely fantastic way to write and edit GitHub Actions workflows! Much much better than what I was doing before - which was just writing plain text files in Sublime Text (ie no plugins).

Further along in the course, the instructor points out that you can get most of the same benefits of using Visual Studio + GitHub Action extension by simply editing a workflow file directly in the browser on GitHub. I had no idea! Very useful.

The work-directory key will be very useful. I'm sure I previously wrote many scripts where I "cd-ed" into the directory I needed to be in. Now that messy code can all be eliminated.
